I essentially glanced over dominion.c and looked for functions for which their purpose is obvious.
With all tests performed there's still less than 30% coverage, so it would very time consuming to manually
test each card and function. Additionally, there are functions that appear to have bugs so it was difficult
to determine how to test for them without knowing the expected outcome. Perhaps I need to become even more
familiar with the game?
